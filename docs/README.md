# Stanford Poster Project

## The Problem

So, you go to one of the greatest universities in the world. You spend most of a quarter, maybe 7 weeks of your life, working on a research project for a class. Then at the end you're told to make a poster. Something to display the fruits of your labor. Maybe you've never made a poster before; maybe you have made a poster but never while at Stanford. Regardless the first thing you probably do is search for templates. 

This is a smart move. There should be templates. Most universities afford students templates, they're an excellent way for institutions to ensure students follow university style guidelines. In fact, if you search for stanford templates you likely find this, from an electrical engineering course taught in 2016:



This is a terrible poster template. It fails almost all of the [university style requirements](https://identity.stanford.edu/). 

It uses Bright Red instead of [Cardinal Red](https://identity.stanford.edu/color.html), the horror. 

It uses Helvetica instead of [Source Sans Pro](https://identity.stanford.edu/typography.html), a crime if there ever was one. 

This poster template doesn't desrve you. It doesn't deserve to host the weeks of work you labored on this final project. Even if you started the project three hours ago and just found this because it's 10 pm and the poster is due in two hours, this template still doesn't deserve your work.

Despite all of this, when you walk around a Stanford poster presentation, all you see is posters built on this template. This is a travesty the scale of which is hard to articulate. The goal of this repository is to correct the horrifying state of Stanford University poster presentations. 

## Our Templates

The key to good design is following the style guidelines. Well really the key to good design is being a good designer with a good artistic sense, but that's not super actionable. Second best for those of us who don't have the flair for designwould be getting expert advice. The experts are busy though, and don't have time to deal with thousands of requests to help design posters for CS {insert number here}. So the experts make style guidelines. Which beings us back to 1: follow the style guidelines.

Following this principle, the templates here are designed in accordance with all university guidelines on color, typography, and branding. As such they are *only to be used by university students presenting on behalf of the university.* We take no responsibility if you use this to present your startup idea to some VC firm and then Stanford sues you for everything. 

We currently have four templates in two sizes, 36 x 24 (the standard for most CS classes) and 42 x 36 (the standard for most other things). Each size offers a template with an abstract and a template without an abstract.
